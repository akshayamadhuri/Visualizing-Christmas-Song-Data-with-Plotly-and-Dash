# Data Cleaning and Preparation with Billboard Christmas Dataset

## Loading the Dataset and Data Type Assessment
Preparing it for data visualization. Start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. This step will set a strong foundation for data cleaning by giving us a preview of the dataset's structure.

First, let's double-check the structure of our dataset:

```Python

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('billboard_christmas.csv')
print(df.head())
```
The output of the above code will be:

```Plain text

                                                 url      weekid  ...  month day
0  http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-1...  12/13/1958  ...     12  13
1  http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-1...  12/20/1958  ...     12  20
2  http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-1...  12/20/1958  ...     12  20
3  http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-1...  12/20/1958  ...     12  20
4  http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-1...  12/27/1958  ...     12  27

[5 rows x 13 columns]
```
Take special note of the weekid column. We'll be converting this into a datetime format to leverage datetime features in the next steps. Understanding data types will help us decode and work with data correctly.

## Date Conversion and Feature Creation

Having a look at weekid, let's convert it to a datetime format, which enables us to easily extract month and week details. Extracting these details will enhance your dataset with temporal features that can aid in identifying trends.

The following code snippet carries out these conversions:

```Python

# Convert 'weekid' to datetime
df['weekid'] = pd.to_datetime(df['weekid'])

# Extract month and week of year from the date
df['month'] = df['weekid'].dt.month
df['week_of_year'] = df['weekid'].dt.isocalendar().week

# Create a boolean feature for December
df['is_december'] = df['month'] == 12

# Print the head of the dataframe to see new columns
print(df[['weekid', 'month', 'week_of_year', 'is_december']].head())
```
The output of the above code will be:

```Plain text

[5 rows x 13 columns]
      weekid  month  week_of_year  is_december
0 1958-12-13     12            50         True
1 1958-12-20     12            51         True
2 1958-12-20     12            51         True
3 1958-12-20     12            51         True
4 1958-12-27     12            52         True
```
By converting weekid and using .dt.month and .dt.isocalendar().week, we enrich the dataset with new dimensions for identifying seasonal patterns. The is_december feature efficiently flags entries that occur in December, pivotal for holiday-focused analysis.

## Data Quality Checks

Ensuring data quality is crucial before any analysis. Let's assess missing values and potential duplicate records. Pandas offers methods to do this quickly:

```Python

# Check for missing values
print("Missing values by column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Check for duplicate rows
print("\nDuplicate rows:", df.duplicated().sum())
```
The output of the above code will be:

```Plain text

Missing values by column:
url                         0
weekid                      0
week_position               0
song                        0
performer                   0
songid                      0
instance                    0
previous_week_position    108
peak_position               0
weeks_on_chart              0
year                        0
month                       0
day                         0
week_of_year                0
is_december                 0
dtype: int64

Duplicate rows: 0
```
This result indicates that our dataset has a few missing values for the previous_week_position column and no duplicate rows, eliminating common data quality concerns and simplifying the subsequent analysis steps.

## Standardizing Text Data
Next, let's ensure the uniformity of our text data for consistent results in analysis and visualization. We'll perform two main text standardization steps on song and performer names: removing extra spaces and converting the text to title case.

```Python

# Strip whitespace and capitalize the first letter of each word in 'song' and 'performer'
df['song'] = df['song'].str.strip().str.title()
df['performer'] = df['performer'].str.strip().str.title()

# Print the first few rows to see changes
print(df[['song', 'performer']].head())
```
By using the `.str.strip()` method, we eliminate any unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of the text, and with `.str.title()`, we ensure that each word starts with a capital letter. The output of the above code will be:

```Plain text

               song     performer
0   Run Rudolph Run   Chuck Berry
1  Jingle Bell Rock   Bobby Helms
2   Run Rudolph Run   Chuck Berry
3   White Christmas   Bing Crosby
4   Green Chri$Tma$  Stan Freberg
```
This transformation not only standardizes the format but also enhances readability and consistency, which is crucial for accurate text-based analyses or visualizations.

## Saving the Cleaned Dataset

The final step is to save the cleaned dataset. A clean dataset will facilitate analysis and visualization and ensure reproducibility of results:

```Python

# Create a clean copy and save to a new CSV file
df_clean = df.copy()
df_clean.to_csv('billboard_christmas_clean.csv', index=False)

print("Data saved to 'billboard_christmas_clean.csv'")
```
The output of the above code will be:

```Python

Data saved to 'billboard_christmas_clean.csv'
```
This message confirms that the cleaned dataset has been successfully saved to a new file, marking the completion of the data preparation phase and ensuring our data is ready for detailed analysis and visualization.
